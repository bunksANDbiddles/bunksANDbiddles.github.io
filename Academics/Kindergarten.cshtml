<span class="win-type-body" >When your child enrolls at Bunks & Biddles School, it is the beginning of a rich and varied journey. One that will see joy, inspiration, victories and challenges. These elements all combine, every moment of every day, to lay the groundwork for a rewarding future. It is education beyond learning, a vibrant fusion of many different experiences while viewing mistakes as an opportunity to learn and this embraces all the formative elements of a young life.
 
I welcome you, your child and your family to discover the true advantage of the Bunks experience. You will see that we are truly preparing our students for what’s ahead as we immerse them in an education that extends far beyond the limits of traditional academic learning while every child is exposed to the biblical principles which is what will take the child through life and its challenges.

Montessori students learn through hands on experiences, experiments and research.  They become actively engaged in their work rather than passively waiting to be spoon fed.  Students develop self-discipline and an internal sense of purpose and motivation.  After graduation from Montessori education, these values serve them well in higher learning and their lives as adults.  Incorporating the ACE curriculum, students are prepared join ACE curriculum school for      primary or any other curriculum.  Our students have joined schools offering 8-4-4 and IGCSE curriculum.
