<span class="win-type-body" >When your child enrolls at Bunks & Biddles School, it is the beginning of a rich and varied journey. One that will see joy, inspiration, victories and challenges. These elements all combine, every moment of every day, to lay the groundwork for a rewarding future. It is education beyond learning, a vibrant fusion of many different experiences while viewing mistakes as an opportunity to learn and this embraces all the formative elements of a young life.
 
I welcome you, your child and your family to discover the true advantage of the Bunks experience. You will see that we are truly preparing our students for what’s ahead as we immerse them in an education that extends far beyond the limits of traditional academic learning while every child is exposed to the biblical principles which is what will take the child through life and its challenges.
